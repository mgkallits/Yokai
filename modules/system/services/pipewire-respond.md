Yes, you can achieve this by using **audio routing** and **noise suppression** techniques. Here's how you can set it up on NixOS with PipeWire and Easy Effects:

### 1. **Use Easy Effects for Noise Suppression**

Easy Effects (formerly PulseEffects) is a powerful tool for applying audio effects, including noise suppression. You can use it to cancel out background music from your microphone input.

#### Steps:
1. **Install Easy Effects**:
   Ensure Easy Effects is installed and configured in your system:
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p easyeffects
   ```

2. **Configure Noise Suppression**:
   - Open Easy Effects.
   - Go to the **Input** tab.
   - Add a **Noise Suppression** filter.
   - Adjust the settings to suppress background music effectively.

3. **Apply the Filter**:
   - Ensure the filter is enabled for your microphone input.
   - Test the setup by playing music and speaking into the microphone. The music should be suppressed in the microphone output.

### 2. **Use PipeWire for Advanced Routing**

If you need more advanced control, you can use PipeWire to route audio streams and apply effects programmatically.

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Virtual Microphone**:
   Use PipeWire to create a virtual microphone that applies noise suppression to your physical microphone input.

2. **Route Audio Streams**:
   - Route your music playback to the speakers.
   - Route your microphone input through the noise suppression filter and then to the virtual microphone.

3. **Configure Applications**:
   - Set your communication apps (e.g., Zoom, Discord) to use the virtual microphone as the input device.

### 3. **Example Configuration**

Hereâ€™s how you can configure PipeWire and Easy Effects to achieve this:

#### Easy Effects Configuration:
1. Open Easy Effects.
2. Go to the **Input** tab.
3. Add a **Noise Suppression** filter.
4. Adjust the filter settings to suppress background music.

#### PipeWire Configuration:
Add the following to your `configuration.nix` to create a virtual microphone and apply noise suppression:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, username, ... }:

{
  services.pipewire = {
    enable = true;
    alsa.enable = true;
    pulse.enable = true;
    wireplumber.enable = true;
    jack.enable = true;

    extraConfig.pipewire = {
      # Create a virtual microphone with noise suppression
      "99-virtual-mic" = {
        "context.objects" = [
          {
            factory = "support.null-audio-sink";
            args = {
              "node.name" = "virtual-mic";
              "media.class" = "Audio/Source/Virtual";
            };
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    easyeffects
  ];
}
```

### 4. **Testing**

1. **Play Music**:
   - Play music through your speakers.

2. **Test Microphone**:
   - Speak into your microphone while music is playing.
   - Use a communication app (e.g., Zoom, Discord) to verify that the music is suppressed in the microphone output.

### Notes

- **Noise Suppression Quality**: The effectiveness of noise suppression depends on the filter settings and the quality of your microphone.
- **Latency**: Applying effects can introduce latency. Adjust the buffer size and sample rate to minimize latency.
