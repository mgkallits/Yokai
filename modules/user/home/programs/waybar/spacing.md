Here’s a **full table of Unicode space characters**, ordered from the **smallest to the largest** in terms of width. This table includes their Unicode code points, names, descriptions, and example usage.

| **Unicode** | **Name**                     | **Width**                          | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**         |

| `U+2005`    | Four-Per-Em Space            | **1/4th of an em space**          | Wider than a thin space, but narrower than an en space.                         | `{icon}\u2005`      |
| `U+2004`    | Three-Per-Em Space           | **1/3rd of an em space**          | Wider than four-per-em space.                                                   | `{icon}\u2004`      |
| `U+2002`    | En Space                     | **1/2 of an em space**            | Half the width of an em space.                                                  | `{icon}\u2002`      |

| `U+3000`    | Ideographic Space            | **Width of a CJK character**      | Same width as a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean character.                         | `{icon}\u3000`      |
| `U+00A0`    | Non-Breaking Space           | **Same as regular space**         | Prevents line breaks, same width as a regular space.                            | `{icon}\u00A0`      |

### Notes:
1. **Zero-Width Space (`U+200B`)**: Invisible and used for formatting without adding visible space.
2. **Hair Space (`U+200A`)**: The thinnest visible space.
3. **Em Space (`U+2003`)**: The widest space, equal to the font size.
4. **Non-Breaking Spaces (`U+00A0`, `U+202F`)**: Prevent line breaks but have the same width as a regular space or slightly wider.
5. **Ideographic Space (`U+3000`)**: Used in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) contexts, typically wider than an em space.

### Example Usage in Waybar
Here’s how you can use these spaces in your Waybar configuration:

```json
"power-profiles-daemon": {
    "format": "{icon}\u2009",  // Thin space after the icon
    "tooltip-format": "Power profile: {profile}\nDriver: {driver}",
    "tooltip": true,
    "format-icons": {
        "default": "",
        "performance": "",
        "balanced": "",
        "power-saver": ""
    }
}
```

---

### Recommendations
- For **very small spacing**, use `U+200A` (hair space) or `U+2009` (thin space).
- For **medium spacing**, use `U+2005` (four-per-em space) or `U+2004` (three-per-em space).
- For **non-breaking spaces**, use `U+202F` (narrow no-break space) or `U+00A0` (non-breaking space).

Experiment with these options to find the spacing that works best for your Waybar setup!
